## Architecture Overview

The project consists of several components:

### 🗄️ Datastore (`crates/datastore`)
Postgres storage layer that provides API's to persist and retrieve bundles.

### 📊 Audit (`crates/audit`)
Event streaming and archival system that:
- Provides an API to publish bundle events to Kafka
- Archives bundle history to S3 for long-term storage
- See [S3 Storage Format](docs/AUDIT_S3_FORMAT.md) for data structure details

### 🔌 Ingress RPC (`crates/ingress-rpc`)
The main entry point that provides a JSON-RPC API for receiving transactions and bundles.

### 🖥️ UI (`ui`)
A debug UI for viewing the state of the bundle store and S3.
